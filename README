SYNOPSIS
    To use, simply add the "paginate" keyword to any route that should
    support HTTP Range headers.

        get '/secret' => paginate sub { ... }
        ...

    Determines if paginate should only operate on Ajax requests.

  Mode
    Options: *headers|parameters|both* Default: headers

    parameters, or both.

    If set to both, headers will be preferred.

    Header mode will look for the following 2 Headers:

    Content-Range
    Range-Unit

    Add proper headers and change status to 206 if coderef was successful.

    range - An arrayref of [start, end]
    range_unit - The Range Unit provided in the request.

    customize response:

    total - The total count of items. Will be replaced with '*' if not
    provided.
    return_range - An arrayref of provided [start, end] values in your
    response. Original will be reused if not provided.
